# infoLogger

The project is consisted mainly of a REST api and a REST client. The client is collecting some useful information about a given process in the system and POSTs them to the API.
API will receive them and parse the response and save them in a text log file.

To try the project:

- clone the project into a directory.
- Start server.js by running : node server.js
- Start monitor.js by running : node monitor.js

Notes:
- So far only tested on Mac OS Darwin and Linux Ubuntu 14.04.
